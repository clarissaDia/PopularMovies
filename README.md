Popular Movies STAGE 1.

This project is developed within the Udacity Android developer Nanodegree programm.

The intent of this app is to fetch data from internet via API, build a Ui for multiple screen Activities and launch them using intents.

The app contains 2 activities: 

-MainActivity which displays in a grid a list of movies. 

-DetailActivity which contains detailed information about each movie. 

The UI is populated by using a custom adapter a recyclerView and the ClickListener to call the intent that starts the DetailActivity. 

To handle the image loading was added Piacasso Library. 

The API from themoviedb.org (https://www.themoviedb.org/) has been used to fetch the movies. 
The API key has been removed from this repository. To test the app you will need your personal API KEY.
